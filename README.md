## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: 
I know exactly what i want my application to look like/want it to do. I can plan well for what needs to be done/how long it will take.

### Weaknesses: 
At times Linking up can confuse me, as well as styling within react; styling is fairly easier for me in comparison to JS but going between different files can throw me off guard a little bit.

### Opportunities: 
This project will give me the chance to let my understanding of react really sink in. I also am hoping to look a little into three.js during this project to see what I may be able to do in this project, or how I may be able to utilize it in future projects.

### Threats: 
I tend to doubt that I know answers to my problems even when I really do. I can tend to freeze up a bit because I don't want to get it wrong, but need to try it and fail because most of the time I do know answers.
